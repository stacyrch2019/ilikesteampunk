<h1>Steampunk</h1>

<p>Steampunk is a subgenre of science fiction that incorporates retrofuturistic technology and aesthetics
  inspired by 19th-century industrial steam-powered machinery. Steampunk works are often set in an alternative history
  of the Victorian era or the American "Wild West", where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that
  similarly employs steam power.</p>

<p>Steampunk most recognizably features anachronistic technologies or retrofuturistic inventions as people in the 19th century might
  have envisioned them — distinguishing it from Neo-Victorianism[4] — and is likewise rooted in the era's perspective on fashion, culture,
  alternative-history-style presentations of such technology as steam cannons, lighter-than-air airships, analog computers,
  or such digital mechanical computers as Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine.</p>

<p>Steampunk may also incorporate additional elements from the genres of fantasy, horror, historical fiction, alternate history,
  or other branches of speculative fiction, making it often a hybrid genre. As a form of speculative fiction, it explores
  alternative futures or pasts but can also address real-world social issues. The first known appearance of the term steampunk
  was in 1987, though it now retroactively refers to many works of fiction created as far back as the 1950s or earlier A popular
  subgenre is Japanese steampunk, consisting of steampunk-themed manga and anime, with steampunk elements having appeared in
  mainstream manga since the 1940s.</p>

<p>Steampunk also refers to any of the artistic styles, clothing fashions, or subcultures that have developed from the aesthetics
  of steampunk fiction, Victorian-era fiction, art nouveau design, and films from the mid-20th century. Various modern utilitarian
  objects have been modded by individual artisans into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style, and a number of visual and
  musical artists have been described as steampunk.</p>
