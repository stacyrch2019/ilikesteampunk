<h3>Art and design</h3>

<p>Many of the visualisations of steampunk have their origins with, among others, Walt Disney's film 20,000 Leagues Under
  the Sea (1954), including the design of the story's submarine the Nautilus, its interiors, and the crew's underwater gear;
  and George Pal's film The Time Machine (1960), especially the design of the time machine itself. This theme is also carried over
  to Six Flags Magic Mountain and Disney parks, in the themed area the "Screampunk District" at Six Flags Magic Mountain and in the
  designs of The Mysterious Island section of Tokyo DisneySea theme park and Disneyland Paris' Discoveryland area.</p>

<p>Aspects of steampunk design emphasise a balance between form and function. In this it is like the Arts and Crafts Movement.
  But John Ruskin, William Morris, and the other reformers in the late nineteenth century rejected machines and industrial production.
  On the other hand, steampunk enthusiasts present a "non-luddite critique of technology".</p>

<p>Various modern utilitarian objects have been modified by enthusiasts into a pseudo-Victorian mechanical "steampunk" style.
  Examples include computer keyboards and electric guitars. The goal of such redesigns is to employ appropriate materials (such as
  polished brass, iron, wood, and leather) with design elements and craftsmanship consistent with the Victorian era, rejecting
  the aesthetic of industrial design.</p>

<p>In 1994, the Paris Metro station at Arts et Métiers was redesigned by Belgian artist Francois Schuiten in steampunk style, to honor
  the works of Jules Verne. The station is reminiscent of a submarine, sheathed in brass with giant cogs in the ceiling and portholes
  that look out onto fanciful scenes.</p>

<p>The artist group Kinetic Steam Works brought a working steam engine to the Burning Man festival in 2006 and 2007. The
  group's founding member, Sean Orlando, created a Steampunk Tree House (in association with a group of people who would later form
  the Five Ton Crane Arts Group) that has been displayed at a number of festivals. The Steampunk Tree House is now
  permanently installed at the Dogfish Head Brewery in Milton, Delaware.</p>

<p>The Neverwas Haul is a three-story, self-propelled mobile art vehicle built to resemble a Victorian house on wheels. Designed by
  Shannon O’Hare, it was built by volunteers in 2006 and presented at the Burning Man festival from 2006 through 2015. When fully
  built, the Haul propelled itself at a top speed of 5 miles per hour and required a crew of ten people to operate safely. Currently,
  the Neverwas Haul makes her home at Obtainium Works, an "art car factory" in Vallejo, CA, owned by O’Hare and home to several other
  self-styled "contraptionists".</p>

<p>In May–June 2008, multimedia artist and sculptor Paul St George exhibited outdoor interactive video installations linking London
  and Brooklyn, New York, in a Victorian era-styled telectroscope.[58][59] Utilizing this device, New York promoter Evelyn Kriete
  organised a transatlantic wave between steampunk enthusiasts from both cities, prior to White Mischief's Around the World in
  80 Days steampunk-themed event.</p>

<p>In 2009, for Questacon, artist Tim Wetherell created a large wall piece that represented the concept of the clockwork universe.
  his steel artwork contains moving gears, a working clock, and a movie of the moon's terminator in action. The 3D moon movie was
  created by Antony Williams.</p>

<p>Steampunk became a common descriptor for homemade objects sold on the craft network Etsy between 2009 and 2011, though many of
  the objects and fashions bear little resemblance to earlier established descriptions of steampunk. Thus the craft network may not
  strike observers as "sufficiently steampunk" to warrant its use of the term. Comedian April Winchell, author of the book Regretsy:
  Where DIY meets WTF, cataloged some of the most egregious and humorous examples on her website "Regretsy". The blog was popular
  among steampunks and even inspired a music video that went viral in the community and was acclaimed by steampunk "notables".</p>

<p>From October 2009 through February 2010, the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford, hosted the first major exhibition of
  steampunk art objects, curated and developed by New York artist and designer Art Donovan, who also exhibited his own
  "electro-futuristic" lighting sculptures, and presented by Dr. Jim Bennett, museum director. From redesigned practical items
  to fantastical contraptions, this exhibition showcased the work of eighteen steampunk artists from across the globe. The exhibition
  proved to be the most successful and highly attended in the museum's history and attracted more than eighty thousand visitors.
  The event was detailed in the official artist's journal The Art of Steampunk, by curator Donovan.</p>

<p>In November 2010, The Libratory Steampunk Art Gallery was opened by Damien McNamara in Oamaru, New Zealand. Created from
  papier-mâché to resemble a large cave and filled with industrial equipment from yesteryear, rayguns, and general steampunk quirks,
  its purpose is to provide a place for steampunkers in the region to display artwork for sale all year long. A year later, a more
  permanent gallery, Steampunk HQ, was opened in the former Meeks Grain Elevator Building across the road from The Woolstore, and has
  since become a notable tourist attraction for Oamaru.</p>

<p>In 2012, the Mobilis in Mobili: An Exhibition of Steampunk Art and Appliance made its debut. Originally located at New York City's
  Wooster Street Social Club (itself the subject of the television series NY Ink), the exhibit featured working steampunk tattoo
  systems designed by Bruce Rosenbaum, of ModVic and owner of the Steampunk House, Joey "Dr. Grymm" Marsocci, and Christopher
  Conte. with different approaches. "[B]icycles, cell phones, guitars, timepieces and entertainment systems" rounded out
  the display. The opening night exhibition featured a live performance by steampunk band Frenchy and the Punk.</p>

<p>Steampunk fashion has no set guidelines but tends to synthesize modern styles with influences from the Victorian era. Such
  influences may include bustles, corsets, gowns, and petticoats; suits with waistcoats, coats, top hats and bowler hats
  (themselves originating in 1850 England), tailcoats and spats; or military-inspired garments. Steampunk-influenced outfits are
  usually accented with several technological and "period" accessories: timepieces, parasols, flying/driving goggles, and ray
  guns. Modern accessories like cell phones or music players can be found in steampunk outfits, after being modified to give them
  the appearance of Victorian-era objects. Post-apocalyptic elements, such as gas masks, ragged clothing, and tribal motifs, can
  also be included. Aspects of steampunk fashion have been anticipated by mainstream high fashion, the Lolita and aristocrat styles,
  neo-Victorianism, and the romantic goth subculture.</p>

<p>In 2005, Kate Lambert, known as "Kato", founded the first steampunk clothing company, "Steampunk Couture", mixing Victorian
  and post-apocalyptic influences. In 2013, IBM predicted, based on an analysis of more than a half million public posts on message
  boards, blogs, social media sites, and news sources, "that 'steampunk,' a subgenre inspired by the clothing, technology and social
  mores of Victorian society, will be a major trend to bubble up and take hold of the retail industry". Indeed, high fashion
  lines such as Prada,[80] Dolce & Gabbana, Versace, Chanel,[81] and Christian Dior[79] had already been introducing steampunk styles
  on the fashion runways. And in episode 7 of Lifetime's "Project Runway: Under the Gunn" reality series, contestants were challenged
  to create avant-garde "steampunk chic" looks. America's Next Top Model tackled Steampunk fashion in a 2012 episode where models
  competed in a Steampunk themed photo shoot, posing in front of a steam train while holding a live owl.</p>

<h3>Literature</h3>

<p>The educational book Elementary BASIC - Learning to Program Your Computer in BASIC with Sherlock Holmes (1981), by Henry Singer and
  Andrew Ledgar, may have been the first fictional work to depict the use of Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine in an adventure story.
   The instructional book, aimed at young programming students, depicts Holmes using the engine as an aid in his investigations, and
   lists programs that perform simple data processing tasks required to solve the fictional cases. The book even describes a device
   that allows the engine to be used remotely, over telegraph lines, as a possible enhancement to Babbage's machine. Companion
   volumes—Elementary Pascal - Learning to Program Your Computer in Pascal with Sherlock Holmes and From Baker Street to
   Binary - An Introduction to Computers and Computer Programming with Sherlock Holmes—were also written.</p>

<p>In 1988, the first version of the science fiction tabletop role-playing game Space: 1889 was published. The game is set in an
  alternative history in which certain now discredited Victorian scientific theories were probable and led to new technologies.
  Contributing authors included Frank Chadwick, Loren Wiseman, and Marcus Rowland.[84]</p>

<p>William Gibson and Bruce Sterling's novel The Difference Engine (1990) is often credited with bringing about widespread awareness
  of steampunk.[8][85] This novel applies the principles of Gibson and Sterling's cyberpunk writings to an alternative Victorian era
  where Ada Lovelace and Charles Babbage's proposed steam-powered mechanical computer, which Babbage called a difference engine
  (a later, more general-purpose version was known as an Analytical Engine), was actually built, and led to the dawn of the information
   age more than a century "ahead of schedule". This setting was different from most steampunk settings in that it takes a dim and
   dark view of this future, rather than the more prevalent utopian versions.</p>

<p>Nick Gevers's original anthology Extraordinary Engines (2008) features newer steampunk stories by some of the genre's writers, as
  well as other science fiction and fantasy writers experimenting with neo-Victorian conventions. A retrospective reprint anthology of
   steampunk fiction was released, also in 2008, by Tachyon Publications. Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer and appropriately entitled
   Steampunk, it is a collection of stories by James Blaylock, whose "Narbondo" trilogy is typically considered steampunk; Jay Lake,
   author of the novel Mainspring, sometimes labeled "clockpunk"; the aforementioned Michael Moorcock; as well as Jess Nevins,
   known for his annotations to The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (first published in 1999).</p>

<p>Younger readers have also been targeted by steampunk themes, by authors such as Philip Reeve and Scott Westerfeld. Reeve's
  quartet Mortal Engines is set far in Earth's future where giant moving cities consume each other in a battle for resources, a
  concept Reeve coined as Municipal Darwinism. Westerfeld's Leviathan trilogy is set during an alternate First World War fought
  between the "clankers" (Central Powers), who use steam technology, and "darwinists" (Allied Powers), who use genetically engineered
  reatures instead of machines.</p>

<p>"Mash-ups" are also becoming increasingly popular in books aimed at younger readers, mixing steampunk with other genres. Suzanne
  Lazear's Aether Chronicles series mixes steampunk with faeries, and The Unnaturalists, by Tiffany Trent, combines steampunk with
  mythological creatures and alternate history.</p>

<p>While most of the original steampunk works had a historical setting,[citation needed] later works often place steampunk elements in a
   fantasy world with little relation to any specific historic era. Historical steampunk tends to be science fiction that presents an
   alternate history; it also contains real locales and persons from history with alternative fantasy technology. "Fantasy-world
   steampunk", such as China Miéville's Perdido Street Station, Alan Campbell's Scar Night, and Stephen Hunt's Jackelian novels, on the
    other hand, presents steampunk in a completely imaginary fantasy realm, often populated by legendary creatures coexisting with
    steam-era and other anachronistic technologies. However, the works of China Miéville and similar authors are sometimes referred
    to as belonging to the "New Weird" rather than steampunk.[citation needed]</p>

<p>Self-described author of "far-fetched fiction" Robert Rankin has incorporated elements of steampunk into narrative worlds that are
   both Victorian and re-imagined contemporary. In 2009, he was made a Fellow of the Victorian Steampunk Society.</p>

<p>The comic book series Hellboy, created by Mike Mignola, and the two Hellboy films featuring Ron Perlman and directed by Guillermo
   del Toro, all have steampunk elements.[91] In the comic book and the first (2004) film, Karl Ruprecht Kroenen is a Nazi SS scientist
    who has an addiction to having himself surgically altered, and who has many mechanical prostheses, including a clockwork heart.
    The character Johann Krauss is featured in the comic and in the second film, Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008), as an ectoplasmic
    medium (a gaseous form in a partly mechanical suit). This second film also features the Golden Army itself, which is a collection
    of 4,900 mechanical steampunk warriors.</p>

<h3>Steampunk settings</h3>

<h4>Alternative world</h4>

<p>Since the 1990s, the application of the steampunk label has expanded beyond works set in recognisable historical periods, to works
   set in fantasy worlds that rely heavily on steam- or spring-powered technology. One of the earliest short stories relying on
   steam-powered flying machines is "The Aerial Burglar" of 1844. An example from juvenile fiction is The Edge Chronicles by Paul
   Stewart and Chris Riddell.</p>

<p>Fantasy steampunk settings abound in tabletop and computer role-playing games. Notable examples include Skies of Arcadia,[93]
  Rise of Nations: Rise of Legends, and Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura.</p>

<p>One of the first steampunk novels set in a Middle-earth-like world was the Forest of Boland Light Railway by BB, about gnomes who
   build a steam locomotive. 50 years later, Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld novel Raising Steam, about the ongoing industrial
   revolution and railway mania in Ankh-Morpork.</p>

<p>The Dwarves of the Elder Scrolls series, described therein as a race of Elves called the Dwemer, also use steam-powered machinery,
  with gigantic brass-like gears, throughout their underground cities. However, magical means are used to keep ancient devices in
  motion despite the Dwemer's ancient disappearance.</p>

<p>The 1998 game Thief: The Dark Project, as well as the other sequels including its 2014 reboot, feature heavy steampunk-inspired
  architecture, setting, and technology.</p>

<p>Amidst the historical and fantasy subgenres of steampunk is a type that takes place in a hypothetical future or a fantasy
  equivalent of our future involving the domination of steampunk-style technology and aesthetics. Examples include Jean-Pierre
  Jeunet and Marc Caro's The City of Lost Children (1995), Turn A Gundam (1999–2000), Trigun, and Disney's film Treasure
  Planet (2002). In 2011, musician Thomas Dolby heralded his return to music after a 20-year hiatus with an online steampunk
  alternate fantasy world called the Floating City, to promote his album A Map of the Floating City.</p>

<h4>American West</h4>

<p>Another setting is "Western" steampunk, which overlaps with both the Weird West and Science fiction Western subgenres.
  One of the earliest steampunk books set in America was The Steam Man of the Prairies by Edward S. Ellis. Recent examples include
   the TV show and the movie adaption Wild Wild West, the Italian comics about Magico Vento,[98] Devon Monk's Dead Iron, and the
   Big Thunder Mountain Railroad in Disneyland-style Disney Parks around the world.[citation needed]</p>

<h4>Fantasy and horror</h4>
<p><em>See also: Cyberpunk derivatives</em></p>

<p>Kaja Foglio introduced the term "Gaslight Romance", gaslamp fantasy, which John Clute and John Grant define as "steampunk
  stories ... most commonly set in a romanticised, smoky, 19th-century London, as are Gaslight Romances. But the latter category
  focuses nostalgically on icons from the late years of that century and the early years of the 20th century—on Dracula, Jekyll and
  Hyde, Jack the Ripper, Sherlock Holmes and even Tarzan—and can normally be understood as combining supernatural fiction and
  recursive fantasy, though some gaslight romances can be read as fantasies of history." Author/artist James Richardson-Brown[100]
   coined the term steamgoth to refer to steampunk expressions of fantasy and horror with a "darker" bent.</p>

<h4>Post-apocalyptic</h4>

<p>Mary Shelley's The Last Man, set near the end of the 21st century after a plague had brought down civilization, was probably the
  ancestor of post-apocalyptic steampunk literature. Post-apocalyptic steampunk is set in a world where some cataclysm has precipitated
  the fall of civilization and steam power is once again ascendant, such as in Hayao Miyazaki's post-apocalyptic anime Future Boy
  Conan (1978, loosely based on Alexander Key's The Incredible Tide (1970)), where a war fought with superweapons has devastated
  the planet. Robert Brown's novel, The Wrath of Fate (as well as much of Abney Park's music) is set in a Victorianesque world where
  an apocalypse was set into motion by a time-traveling mishap. Cherie Priest's Boneshaker series is set in a world where a zombie
  apocalypse happened during the Civil War era. The Peshawar Lancers by S.M. Stirling is set in a post-apocalyptic future in whic
  a meteor shower in 1878 caused the collapse of Industrialized civilization. The movie 9 (which might be better classified as
  "stitchpunk" but was largely influenced by steampunk)[101] is also set in a post-apocalyptic world after a self-aware war machine
  ran amok. Steampunk Magazine even published a book called A Steampunk's Guide to the Apocalypse, about how steampunks could
  survive should such a thing actually happen.</p>

<h4>Victorian</h4>

<p>In general, this category includes any recent science fiction that takes place in a recognizable historical period (sometimes
  an alternate history version of an actual historical period) in which the Industrial Revolution has already begun, but electricity
  is not yet widespread, "usually Britain of the early to mid-nineteenth century or the fantasized Wild West-era United States",[102]
  with an emphasis on steam- or spring-propelled gadgets. The most common historical steampunk settings are the Victorian and
  Edwardian eras, though some in this "Victorian steampunk" category are set as early as the beginning of the Industrial Revolution
  and as late as the end of World War I.</p>

<p>Some examples of this type include the novel The Difference Engine,[103] the comic book series League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,
  the Disney animated film Atlantis: The Lost Empire, Scott Westerfeld's Leviathan trilogy, and the roleplaying game Space:
  1889. The anime film Steamboy (2004) is another good example of Victorian steampunk, taking place in an alternate 1866 where
  steam technology is far more advanced than it ever was in real life. Some, such as the comic series Girl Genius, have their
  own unique times and places despite partaking heavily of the flavor of historic settings. Other comic series are set in a more
  familiar London, as in the Victorian Undead, which has Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Watson, and others taking on zombies, Doctor Jekyll
  and Mister Hyde, and Count Dracula, with advanced weapons and devices.</p>

<p>Karel Zeman's film The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) is a very early example of cinematic steampunk. Based on Jules Verne
  novels, Zeman's film imagines a past that never was, based on those novels. Other early examples of historical steampunk in
  cinema include Hayao Miyazaki's anime films such as Laputa: Castle in the Sky (1986) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), which contain
  many archetypal anachronisms characteristic of the steampunk genre.</p>

<p>"Historical" steampunk usually leans more towards science fiction than fantasy, but a number of historical steampunk stories have
  incorporated magical elements as well. For example, Morlock Night, written by K. W. Jeter, revolves around an attempt by the wizard
  Merlin to raise King Arthur to save the Britain of 1892 from an invasion of Morlocks from the future.<p>

<p>Paul Guinan's Boilerplate, a "biography" of a robot in the late 19th century, began as a website that garnered international press
  coverage when people began believing that Photoshop images of the robot with historic personages were real. The site was
  adapted into the illustrated hardbound book Boilerplate: History's Mechanical Marvel, which was published by Abrams in October
  2009. Because the story was not set in an alternative history, and in fact contained accurate information about the Victorian
  era, some[specify] booksellers referred to the tome as "historical steampunk".<p>

<h4>Asian (silkpunk)</h4>

<p>Fictional settings inspired by Asian rather than Western history have been called "silkpunk". The term appears to originate with
   the author Ken Liu, who defined it as "a blend of science fiction and fantasy [that] draws inspiration from classical East Asian
   antiquity", with a "technology vocabulary (...) based on organic materials historically important to East Asia (bamboo, paper,
   silk) and seafaring cultures of the Pacific (coconut, feathers, coral)", rather than the brass and leather associated with
   steampunk. Liu used the term to describe his Dandelion Dynasty series, which began in 2015. Other works described
  as silkpunk include Neon Yang's Tensorate series of novellas, which began in 2017. Lyndsie Manusos of Book Riot has argued that
  the genre does "not fit in a direct analogy with steampunk. Silkpunk is technology and poetics. It is engineering and
  language."</p>

<h4>Music</h4>

<p>Steampunk music is very broadly defined. Abney Park's lead singer Robert Brown defined it as "mixing Victorian elements and modern
   elements". There is a broad range of musical influences that make up the Steampunk sound, from industrial dance and world music
    to folk rock, dark cabaret to straightforward punk, Carnatic to industrial, hip-hop to opera (and even industrial hip-hop
     opera), darkwave to progressive rock, barbershop to big band.</p>

<p>Joshua Pfeiffer (of Vernian Process) is quoted as saying, "As for Paul Roland, if anyone deserves credit for spearheading Steampunk
   music, it is him. He was one of the inspirations I had in starting my project. He was writing songs about the first attempt at
   manned flight, and an Edwardian airship raid in the mid-80s long before almost anyone else ..." Thomas Dolby is also considered
    one of the early pioneers of retro-futurist (i.e., Steampunk and Dieselpunk) music. Amanda Palmer was once quoted as
    saying, "Thomas Dolby is to Steampunk what Iggy Pop was to Punk!"</p>

<p>Steampunk has also appeared in the work of musicians who do not specifically identify as Steampunk. For example, the music video of
  "Turn Me On", by David Guetta and featuring Nicki Minaj, takes place in a Steampunk universe where Guetta creates human droids.
  Another music video is "The Ballad of Mona Lisa", by Panic! at the Disco, which has a distinct Victorian Steampunk theme.
  A continuation of this theme has in fact been used throughout the 2011 album Vices & Virtues, in the music videos, album art,
  and tour set and costumes. In addition, the album Clockwork Angels (2012) and its supporting tour by progressive rock band Rush
  contain lyrics, themes, and imagery based around Steampunk. Similarly, Abney Park headlined the first "Steamstock" outdoor steampunk
  music festival in Richmond, California, which also featured Thomas Dolby, Frenchy and the Punk, Lee Presson and the Nails, Vernian
  Process, and others.</p>

<p>The music video for the Lindsey Stirling song "Roundtable Rival", has a Western Steampunk setting.</p>

<p>The Fabulous World of Jules Verne (1958) and The Fabulous Baron Munchausen (1962), both directed by Karel Zeman, have steampunk
  elements. The 1965 television series The Wild Wild West, as well as the 1999 film of the same name, features many elements of
  advanced steam-powered technology set in the Wild West time period of the United States. Two Years' Vacation (or The Stolen Airship)
  (1967) directed by Karel Zeman contains steampunk elements.</p>

<p>The BBC series Doctor Who also incorporates steampunk elements. During season 14 of the show (in 1976), the formerly futuristic
  looking interior set was replaced with a Victorian-styled wood-panel and brass affair. In the 1996 American co-production,
  the TARDIS interior was re-designed to resemble an almost Victorian library with the central control console made up of an eclectic
  array of anachronistic objects. Modified and streamlined for the 2005 revival of the series, the TARDIS console continued to
  incorporate steampunk elements, including a Victorian typewriter and gramophone. Several storylines can be classed as steampunk,
  for example: The Evil of the Daleks (1966), wherein Victorian scientists invent a time travel device. Dinner for Adele (1977)
  directed by Oldřich Lipský involves steampunk contraptions. The 1979 film Time After Time has Herbert George "H.G." Wells following
  a surgeon named John Leslie Stevenson into the future, as John is suspected of being Jack the Ripper. Both separately use Wells's
  time machine to travel.</p>

<p>The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians (1981) directed by Oldřich Lipský contains steampunk elements. The 1982 American TV
  series Q.E.D. is set in Edwardian England, stars Sam Waterston as Professor Quentin Everett Deverill (from whose initials, by which
  he is primarily known, the series title is derived, initials which also stand for the Latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum, which
  translates as "which was to be demonstrated"). The Professor is an inventor and scientific detective, in the mold of Sherlock
  Holmes. The plot of the Soviet film Kin-dza-dza! (1986) centers on a desert planet, depleted of its resources, where an impoverished
  dog-eat-dog society uses steam-punk machines, the movements and functions of which defy earthly logic.</p>

<p>In making his 1986 Japanese film Castle in the Sky, Hayao Miyazaki was heavily influenced by steampunk culture, the film featuring
  various air ships and steam-powered contraptions as well as a mysterious island that floats through the sky, accomplished not through
  magic as in most stories, but instead by harnessing the physical properties of a rare crystal—analogous to the lodestone used in the
  Laputa of Swift's Gulliver's Travels—augmented by massive propellers, as befitting the Victorian motif. The first
  "Wallace & Gromit" animation "A Grand Day Out" (1989) features a space rocket in the steampunk style.
  The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr., a 1993 Fox Network TV science fiction-western set in the 1890s, features elements of
  steampunk as represented by the character Professor Wickwire, whose inventions were described as "the coming thing".
  The short-lived 1995 TV show Legend, on UPN, set in 1876 Arizona, features such classic inventions as a steam-driven
  "quadrovelocipede", trigoggle and night-vision goggles (à la teslapunk), and stars John de Lancie as a thinly disguised
  Nikola Tesla.</p>

<p>Alan Moore's and Kevin O'Neill's 1999 The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen graphic novel series (and the subsequent 2003
  film adaption) greatly popularised the steampunk genre.[75]</p>

<p>Steamboy (2004) is a Japanese animated action film directed and co-written by Katsuhiro Otomo (Akira). It is a retro science-fiction
   epic set in a Steampunk Victorian England. It features steamboats, trains, airships and inventors. The 2004 film Lemony Snicket's
   A Series of Unfortunate Events contains Steampunk-esque themes, such as the costumery and vehicle interiors. The 2007 Syfy miniseries
   Tin Man incorporates a considerable number of steampunk-inspired themes into a re-imagining of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard
   of Oz. Despite leaning more towards gothic influences, the "parallel reality" of Meanwhile, City, within the 2009 film Franklyn,
   contains many steampunk themes, such as costumery, architecture, minimal use of electricity (with a preference for gaslight), and
   absence of modern technology (such as there being no motorised vehicles or advanced weaponry, and the manual management of
   information with no use of computers).</p>

<p>The 2009–2014 Syfy television series Warehouse 13 features many steampunk-inspired objects and artifacts, including computer designs
   created by steampunk artisan Richard Nagy, a.k.a. "Datamancer". The 2010 episode of the TV series Castle entitled "Punked"
   (which first aired on October 11, 2010) prominently features the steampunk subculture and uses Los Angeles-area steampunks
   (such as the League of STEAM) as extras. The 2011 film The Three Musketeers has many steampunk elements, including gadgets
   and airships.</p>

  East Asian themes. The Penny Dreadful (2014) television series is a Gothic Victorian fantasy series with steampunk props and
  costumes.</p>

  Steamland, led by an odd industrialist named Alva Gunderson voiced by Richard Ayoade, first appears in the season 1 episode,
  "The Electric Princess." The country is portrayed as driven by logic and is egalitarian, governed by science, rather
  than magic, as is the case for Dreamland, where the protagonist, Princess Bean, is from. The country has cars, automatic
  lights, submarines, and other modern technologies, all of which are steam-powered, and references to Groening's other series,
  Futurama. Steamland appears in three episodes of the show's second season, showing an explorers club as part of the
  country's high society, flying zeppelins, and robots with light bulbs for their heads which chase the protagonists through the
  streets. Some even argued that Steamland is "dieselpunk inspired."</p>

<h4>Video games</h4>
<p>A variety of styles of video games have used steampunk settings.</p>

  considered to be the first steampunk video game. Designed by Yoshinori Satake and inspired by Hayao Miyazaki's anime film Laputa:
  Castle in the Sky (1986), Steel Empire is set in an alternate timeline dominated by steam-powered technology. The commercial success
  of Steel Empire, both in Japan and the West, helped propel steampunk into the video game market, and had a significant influence on
  later steampunk games. The most notable steampunk game it influenced is Final Fantasy VI (1994), a Japanese role-playing game
  developed by Squaresoft and designed by Hiroyuki Ito for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Final Fantasy VI was both
  critically and commercially successful, and had a considerable influence on later steampunk video games.[35]</p>

  (all produced by or under the supervision of Cyan Worlds) take place in an alternate steampunk universe, where elaborate
  infrastructures have been built to run on steam power. The Elder Scrolls (since 1994, last release in 2014) is an action
  role-playing game where one can find an ancient extinct race called dwemers or dwarves, whose steampunk technology is based on

<h4>Culture and community</h4>

<p>Because of the popularity of steampunk, there is a growing movement of adults that want to establish steampunk as a culture and
  lifestyle.[143] Some fans of the genre adopt a steampunk aesthetic through fashion,[144] home decor, music, and film. While
  Steampunk is considered the amalgamation of Victorian aesthetic principles with modern sensibilities and technologies,
  it can be more broadly categorised as neo-Victorianism, described by scholar Marie-Luise Kohlke as "the afterlife of the
  nineteenth century in the cultural imaginary". The subculture has its own magazine, blogs, and online shops.</p>

<p>In September 2012, a panel, chaired by steampunk entertainer Veronique Chevalier and with panelists including magician Pop Hadyn
   and members of the steampunk performance group the League of STEAM, was held at Stan Lee's Comikaze Expo. The panel suggested
   that because steampunk was inclusive of and incorporated ideas from various other subcultures such as goth, neo-Victorian, and
   cyberpunk, as well as a growing number of fandoms, it was fast becoming a super-culture rather than a mere subculture.
   Other steampunk notables such as Professor Elemental have expressed similar views about steampunk's inclusive diversity.</p>

<p>Some have proposed a steampunk philosophy that incorporates punk-inspired anti-establishment sentiments typically bolstered by
  optimism about human potential.[149] A 2004 Steampunk Manifesto, later republished in SteamPunk Magazine, lamented that most
  "so-called" steampunk was nothing more than dressed-up recreationary nostalgia and proposed that "authentic" steampunk would
  "take the levers of technology from the [technocrats] and powerful." American activist and performer Miriam Rosenberg
  Rocek impersonated anarcha-feminist Emma Goldman to inspire discussions around gender, society and politics.[4] SteamPunk
  Magazine was edited and published by anarchists. Its founder, Margaret Killjoy, argued "there have always been radical politics
  at the core of steampunk." Diana M. Pho, a science-fiction editor and author of the multicultural steampunk blog Beyond
  Victoriana, similarly argued steampunk's "progressive roots" can be traced to its literary inspirations, including Verne's Captain
  Nemo. Steampunk authors Phenderson Djèlí Clark, Jaymee Goh, Dru Pagliassotti, and Charlie Stross consider
  their work political.</p>

<p>These views are not universally shared. Killjoy lamented that even some diehard enthusiasts believe steampunk "has nothing to
  offer but designer clothes." Pho argued many steampunk fans "don't like to acknowledge that their attitudes could be considered
   ideological." The largest online steampunk community, Brass Goggles, which is dedicated to what it calls the "lighter side" of
    steampunk, banned discussion about politics. Cory Gross, who was one of the first to write about the history and theory of
    steampunk, argued that the "sepia-toned yesteryear more appropriate for Disney and grandparents than a vibrant and viable
    philosophy or culture" denounced in the Steampunk Manifesto was in fact representative of the genre. Author
    Catherynne M. Valente called the punk in steampunk "nearly meaningless." Kate Franklin and James Schafer, who at the
     time managed one of the largest steampunk groups on Facebook, admitted in 2011 that steampunk hadn't created the "revolutionary,
      or even a particularly progressive" community they wanted. Blogger and podcaster Eric Renderking Fisk announced in 2017
      that steampunk was no longer punk, since it had "lost the anti-authoritarian, anti-establishment aspects."</p>

<p>Others argued explicitly against turning steampunk into a political movement, preferring to see steampunk as "escapism"
   or a "fandom". In 2018, Nick Ottens, editor of the online alternate-history magazine Never Was, declared that the "lighter side"
    of steampunk had won out. To the extent that steampunk is politicized, it appears to be an American and British phenomenon.
    Continental Europeans and Latin Americans[166] are more likely to consider steampunk a hobby than a cause.</p>

<h4>Social events</h4>

<p>June 19, 2005 marked the grand opening of the world's first steampunk club night, "Malediction Society", in Los Angeles.
   The event ran for nearly 12 years at The Monte Cristo nightclub, interrupted by a single year residency at Argyle Hollywood,
   until both the club night and The Monte Cristo closed in April 2017.[168] Though the steampunk aesthetic eventually gave way
   to a more generic goth and industrial aesthetic, Malediction Society celebrated its roots every year with "The
   Steampunk Ball".</p>

<p>2006 saw the first "SalonCon", a neo-Victorian/steampunk convention. It ran for three consecutive years and featured artists,
  musicians (Voltaire and Abney Park), authors (Catherynne M. Valente, Ekaterina Sedia, and G. D. Falksen), salons led by people
  prominent in their respective fields, workshops and panels on steampunk—as well as a seance, ballroom dance instruction, and the
  Chrononauts' Parade. The event was covered by MTV and The New York Times.[24] Since then, a number of popular steampunk
  conventions have sprung up the world over, with names like Steamcon (Seattle), the Steampunk World's Fair (Piscataway, New Jersey),
   Up in the Aether: The Steampunk Convention (Dearborn, Michigan), Steampunk NZ (Oamaru, New Zealand), Steampunk Unlimited
   (Strasburg Railroad, Lancaster, PA). Each year, on Mother's Day weekend, the city of Waltham, MA, turns over its city center
   nd surrounding areas to host the Watch City Steampunk Festival, a US outdoor steampunk festival. During the first weekend of May,
   the Australian town of Nimmitabel celebrates Steampunk @ Altitude with some 2,000 attendance.</p>

<p>In recent years, steampunk has also become a regular feature at San Diego Comic-Con International, with the Saturday of the four-day
   event being generally known among steampunks as "Steampunk Day", and culminating with a photo-shoot for the local press.
   In 2010, this was recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's largest steampunk photo shoot. In 2013,
   Comic-Con announced four official 2013 T-shirts, one of them featuring the official Rick Geary Comic-Con toucan mascot in steampunk
    attire. The Saturday steampunk "after-party" has also become a major event on the steampunk social calendar: in 2010, the
    headliners included The Slow Poisoner, Unextraordinary Gentlemen, and Voltaire, with Veronique Chevalier as Mistress of Ceremonies
     and special appearance by the League of STEAM; in 2011, UXG returned with Abney Park.</p>

<p>Steampunk has also sprung up recently at Renaissance Festivals and Renaissance Faires, in the US. Some festivals have organised
   events or a "Steampunk Day", while others simply support an open environment for donning steampunk attire. The Bristol Renaissance
    Faire in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on the Wisconsin/Illinois border, featured a Steampunk costume contest during the 2012 season,
    the previous two seasons having seen increasing participation in the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Steampunk also has a growing following in the UK and Europe. The largest European event is "Weekend at the Asylum", held at The Lawn,
   Lincoln, every September since 2009. Organised as a not-for-profit event by the Victorian Steampunk Society, the Asylum is a
   dedicated steampunk event which takes over much of the historical quarter of Lincoln, England, along with Lincoln Castle.
   In 2011, there were over 1000 steampunks in attendance. The event features the Empire Ball, Majors Review, Bazaar Eclectica,
   and the international Tea Duelling final. The Surrey Steampunk Convivial was originally held in New Malden,
   but since 2019 has been held in Stoneleigh in southwestern London, within walking distance of H. G. Wells's home.
   The Surrey Steampunk Convivial started as an annual event in 2012, and now takes place thrice a year, and has spanned
   three boroughs and five venues. Attendees have been interviewed by BBC Radio 4 for Phill Jupitus and filmed
   by the BBC World Service. The West Yorkshire village of Haworth has held an annual Steampunk weekend since 2013,
    on each occasion as a charity event raising funds for Sue Ryder's "Manorlands" hospice in Oxenhope.</p>

<h4>Other</h4>
<p>A 2018 physics Ph.D. dissertation used the phrase "Quantum Steampunk" to describe the author's synthesis of some 19th century and
   current ideas. The term has not been adopted by others.</p>

<p>A 2012 conference paper on human factors in computing systems examines the use of steampunk as a design fiction for
   human-computer interaction (HCI). It concludes that "the practices of DIY and appropriation that are evident in Steampunk
    design provide a useful set of design strategies and implications for HCI".</p>
