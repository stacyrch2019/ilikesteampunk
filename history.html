<p>Steampunk is influenced by and often adopts the style of the 19th-century scientific romances of Jules Verne, H. G. Wells,
  Mary Shelley, and Edward S. Ellis's The Steam Man of the Prairies. Several more modern works of art and fiction significant to
  the development of the genre were produced before the genre had a name. Titus Alone (1959), by Mervyn Peake, is widely regarded by
  scholars as the first novel in the genre proper, while others point to Michael Moorcock's 1971 novel The Warlord of the
  Air, which was heavily influenced by Peake's work. The film Brazil (1985) was an early cinematic influence, although it
  can also be considered a precursor to the steampunk offshoot dieselpunk. The Adventures of Luther Arkwright was an early (1970s)
  comic version of the Moorcock-style mover between timestreams.</p>

<p>In fine art, Remedios Varo's paintings combine elements of Victorian dress, fantasy, and technofantasy imagery. In
  television, one of the earliest manifestations of the steampunk ethos in the mainstream media was the CBS television series The Wild
  Wild West (1965–69), which inspired the later film.</p>

<h3>Origin of the term</h3>

<p>Although many works now considered seminal to the genre were published in the 1960s and 1970s, the term steampunk originated largely in the 1980s[27]
  as a tongue-in-cheek variant of cyberpunk. It was coined by science fiction author K. W. Jeter, who was trying to find a general
  term for works by Tim Powers (The Anubis Gates, 1983), James Blaylock (Homunculus, 1986), and himself (Morlock Night, 1979, and
  Infernal Devices, 1987) — all of which took place in a 19th-century (usually Victorian) setting and imitated conventions of such
  actual Victorian speculative fiction as H. G. Wells' The Time Machine. In a letter
  to science fiction magazine Locus,[27] printed in the April 1987 issue, Jeter wrote:</p>

<p>Dear Locus,<br />

Enclosed is a copy of my 1979 novel Morlock Night; I'd appreciate your being so good as to route it to Faren Miller, as it's a prime
piece of evidence in the great debate as to who in "the Powers/Blaylock/Jeter fantasy triumvirate" was writing in the "gonzo-historical
manner" first. Though of course, I did find her review in the March Locus to be quite flattering.<br />

Personally, I think Victorian fantasies are going to be the next big thing, as long as we can come up with a fitting collective term
for Powers, Blaylock and myself. Something based on the appropriate technology of the era; like "steam-punks," perhaps....<br />

— K.W. Jeter</p>

<h3>Modern steampunk</h3>

<p>While Jeter's Morlock Night and Infernal Devices, Powers' The Anubis Gates, and Blaylock's Lord Kelvin's Machine were the first
  novels to which Jeter's neologism would be applied, the three authors gave the term little thought at the time. They were far
  from  the first modern science fiction writers to speculate on the development of steam-based technology or alternative histories.
  Keith Laumer's Worlds of the Imperium (1962) and Ronald W. Clark's Queen Victoria's Bomb (1967) apply modern speculation to past-age
  technology and society. Michael Moorcock's Warlord of the Air (1971) is another early example. Harry Harrison's
  novel A Transatlantic Tunnel, Hurrah! (1973) portrays Britain in an alternative 1973, full of atomic locomotives, coal-powered flying
  boats, ornate submarines, and Victorian dialogue. The Adventures of Luther Arkwright (mid-1970s) was one of the first steampunk
  comics. In February 1980, Richard A. Lupoff and Steve Stiles published the first "chapter" of their 10-part comic
  strip The Adventures of Professor Thintwhistle and His Incredible Aether Flyer. In 2004, one anonymous author described
  steampunk as "Colonizing the Past so we can dream the future."</p>

<p>The first use of the word "steampunk" in a title was in Paul Di Filippo's 1995 Steampunk Trilogy, consisting of three short
  novels: "Victoria", "Hottentots", and "Walt and Emily", which, respectively, imagine the replacement of Queen Victoria by a
  human/newt clone, an invasion of Massachusetts by Lovecraftian monsters, and a love affair between Walt Whitman and Emily
  Dickinson.</p>

<h3>Japanese steampunk</h3>
<p>Japanese steampunk consists of steampunk manga comics and anime productions from Japan. Steampunk elements have consistently
  appeared in mainstream manga since the 1940s, dating back to Osamu Tezuka's epic science-fiction trilogy consisting of Lost World
  (1948), Metropolis (1949) and Nextworld (1951). The steampunk elements found in manga eventually made their way into mainstream
  anime productions starting in the 1970s, including television shows such as Leiji Matsumoto's Space Battleship Yamato (1974)
  and the 1979 anime adaptation of Riyoko Ikeda's manga Rose of Versailles (1972). Influenced by 19th-century European authors such
  as Jules Verne, steampunk anime and manga arose from a Japanese fascination with an imaginary fantastical version of old Industrial
  Europe, linked to a phenomenon called akogare no Pari ("the Paris of our dreams"), comparable to the West's fascination with an
  "exotic" East.</p>

<p>The most influential steampunk animator was Hayao Miyazaki, who was creating steampunk anime since the 1970s, starting with the
  television show Future Boy Conan (1978). His manga Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind (1982) and its 1984 anime film adaptation
  also contained steampunk elements. Miyazaki's most influential steampunk production was the Studio Ghibli anime film Laputa: Castle
  in the Sky (1986), which became a major milestone in the genre and has been described by The Steampunk Bible as "one of the first
  modern steampunk classics." Archetypal steampunk elements in Laputa include airships, air pirates, steam-powered robots, and a
  view of steam power as a limitless but potentially dangerous source of power.</p>

<p>The success of Laputa inspired Hideaki Anno and Studio Gainax to create their first hit production, Nadia: The Secret of Blue
  Water (1990), a steampunk anime show which loosely adapts elements from Verne's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, with Captain
  Nemo making an appearance. Based on a concept by Miyazaki, Nadia was influential on later steampunk anime such as Katsuhiro
  Otomo's anime film Steamboy (2004). Disney's animated steampunk film Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001) was influenced by
  anime, particularly Miyazaki's works and possibly Nadia. Other popular Japanese steampunk works include Miyazaki's Studio
  Ghibli anime films Porco Rosso (1992) and Howl's Moving Castle (2004), Sega's video game and anime franchise Sakura Wars
  (1996) which is set in a steampunk version of Meiji/Taishō era Japan, and Square Enix's manga and anime franchise Fullmetal
  Alchemist (2001).</p>

<h3>Relationships to retrofuturism, DIY craft and making</h3>

<p>Steampunk used to be confused with retrofuturism. Indeed, both sensibilities recall "the older but still modern eras in
  which technological change seemed to anticipate a better world, one remembered as relatively innocent of industrial decline."
  For some scholars, retrofuturism is considered a strand of steampunk, one that looks at alternatives to historical imagination
  and usually created with the same kinds of social protagonists and written for the same type of audiences.</p>

<p>One of steampunk's most significant contributions is the way in which it mixes digital media with traditional handmade art forms.
  As scholars Rachel Bowser and Brian Croxall put it, "the tinkering and tinker-able technologies within steampunk invite us to roll
  up our sleeves and get to work re-shaping our contemporary world." In this respect, steampunk bears more in common with DIY
  craft and making.</p>
